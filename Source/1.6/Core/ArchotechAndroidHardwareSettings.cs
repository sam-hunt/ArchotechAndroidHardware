/// <summary>
/// Mod settings for the Thanatic Reactor balance knobs.
///
/// Balance rationale (VREA 1.6, verified at implementation time — re-verify if
/// VREA internals change):
///
///   Baseline VREA reactor drain (Hediff_AndroidReactor.TickInterval):
///     per-check drain = 1.388889e-7 × PowerEfficiencyDrainMultiplier × 60
///                     ≈ 8.333e-6 energy per 60-tick interval
///     per-day drain (met=0) ≈ 0.008333 → full→empty in ~120 days
///
///   PowerEfficiencyToPowerDrainFactorCurve (AndroidStatsTable) — anchors we've
///   observed in VREA 1.6:
///     biostatMet sum -20 → 6.0× drain
///     biostatMet sum   0 → 1.0× drain (baseline)
///     biostatMet sum  +5 → 0.5× drain
///   The curve shape between anchors is VREA's, not ours, so intermediate
///   multipliers shouldn't be asserted as specific numbers here.
///
///   Thanatic Reactor characteristics:
///     The AAH_ThanaticReactor gene contributes biostatMet -4. That shifts
///     the pawn's sum into an accelerated-drain region of VREA's curve —
///     somewhere between 1.0× (met 0) and 6.0× (met -20) — but the realised
///     multiplier depends on VREA's curve and is the tuning surface (via the
///     gene's biostatMet) rather than a constant we ship here.
///     No separate drain multiplier is applied in C#; all drain scaling
///     happens through VREA's native biostatMet → curve path.
///     ThanaticRefillAmount = 0.35 → each humanlike kill refills 35% of max
///     energy. The sustain cadence (kills per day) depends on the realised
///     drain rate; adjust via the refill knob if the default curve output
///     makes it too tight or too generous.
///     Overflow: any kill while Energy > (1 - refill) overflows into
///     Thanatic Overcharge.
///     Max overcharge from a single kill (kill at Energy=1.0) = 0.35 × 17h ≈ 5h57m
///     Overcharge duration stacks via HediffComp_Disappears extension, capped at 48h
///
/// Design intent: most raids should push Energy into overcharge territory
/// rather than forcing players to hunt for kills to survive. If the realised
/// drain rate undershoots that target, either raise the refill knob or
/// increase the gene's biostatMet magnitude (closer to 0 = slower drain).
